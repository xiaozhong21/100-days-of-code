# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: May 25, 2021


**Today's Progress**:
1. Started the Responsive Web Design section on freeCodeCamp following the Odin Project.
2. Completed several OOP exercises on FCC.

**Thoughts:** While I keep consolidating JavaScript skills in preparation for Techtonica's application workshops, I am excited to start the new section of front-end development on The Odin Project! Things start to connect with all the previously moving pieces - JS, HTML, CSS... Feeling super stoked!

### Day 8: May 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Did a 2-hour pairing programming session on JavaScript with Techtonica applicants and volunteers;
2. Completed several freeCodeCamp OOP exercices.

**Thoughts:** The learning of OOP makes me realize how powerful and efficient OOP can be when coding for complicated problems. Currently the study of OOP on freeCodeCamp still seems fragmented; can't wait to learn more about it so I can apply it in solving a relatively complex code challenge.

### Day 7: May 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished week 2 module on "Environments" for Berkeley's CS61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class;
2. Completed several freeCodeCamp OOP exercices.

**Thoughts:** Finally starting the OOP of JavaScript! So excited!

### Day 6: May 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished week 2 module on "Higher-Order Functions" for Berkeley's CS61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class;
2. Finished freeCodeCamp's basic algorithm exercices.

**Thoughts:** Data structure and algorithms are challenging but critical concepts for laying a solid foundation of CS and for future technical interviews. Feeling good about making progress every day!

### Day 5: May 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished the module on "data science" for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 class;
2. Did a couple freeCodeCamp algorithm exercices.

**Thoughts:** MDN's reference on JS makes me realize that comprehensive and high quality documentation is extremely important. Documenting in and if itself is an art!

### Day 4: May 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished the module on "files" for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 class;
2. Did a couple freeCodeCamp algorithm exercices.

**Thoughts:** Algorithm coding challenges can be tricky and sometimes require out-of-the-box solutions. I need to practice this type of questions more and hopefully I can start consistently practicing using LeetCode soon after finishing the freeCodeCamp ones.

### Day 3: May 20, 2021


**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished the module on "text" for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 class;
2. Did a 2-hour pairing programming session on JavaScript with Techtonica applicants and volunteers;
3. Refreshed myself on Git command line knowledge from the Odin Project curriculum in preparation for tracking and pushing my projects online using command lines.

**Thoughts:** Pair programming and workshops provide great opportunity for me to learn from others - both industry professionals who are ahead of me, and fellow bootcamp applicants who are climbing the learning curve like me. It is important to find my own community and group where I feel safe and comfortable to communicate and learn together.   

### Day 2: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished the module on "dictionaries" for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 class;
2. Did a 1.5-hour pairing programming session on JavaScript with friend.

**Thoughts:** I find myself getting more comfortable with functional programming and using various methods for different data structures. Now the next step is to learn and master object-oriented programming so that my codes can be more efficient. Practice makes perfect!

### Day 1: May 18, 2021


**Today's Progress**:
1. Completed several freeCodeCamp exercises on algorithm;
2. Finished the module on "lists" for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 curriculum;
3. Attended a Data Structure and Algorithm workshop and tackled two leetcode problems;
4. Did a 2-hour pairing programming session on JavaScript with friend.

**Thoughts:** Still trying to get better at object methods and thinking on my feet under time constraints when tackling algorithm questions. Knowing how to code a solution is important, but it is also important to be able to communicate and explain my logic to others.
