# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: May 19, 2021


**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished the module on "dictionaries" for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 class;
2. Did a 1.5-hour pairing programming session on JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I find myself getting more comfortable with functional programming and using various methods for different data structures. Now the next step is to learn and master object-oriented programming so that my codes can be more efficient. Practice makes perfect!

### Day 1: May 18, 2021


**Today's Progress**:
1. Completed several freeCodeCamp exercises on algorithm;
2. Finished the module on "lists" for Stanford's Code in Place 2021 curriculum;
3. Attended a Data Structure and Algorithm workshop and tackled two leetcode problems;
4. Did a 2-hour pairing programming session on JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Still trying to get better at object methods and thinking on my feet under time constraints when tackling algorithm questions. Knowing how to code a solution is important, but it is also important to be able to communicate and explain my logic to others.
