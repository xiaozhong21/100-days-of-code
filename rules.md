# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
May 18th, 2021.

## Additional Rules
1. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
2. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
